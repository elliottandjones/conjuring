# Conjuring

D&D 5e SRD (and personal homebrew) reference and real-time chat room web application. Built for you folks out there who like to use your spell slots to conjure stuff. You can check it out right now at https://conjuring-2b5a2.firebaseapp.com/.

Built with React.js (updated to use the hooks and context APIs), CSS Grid, Node.js, Socket.io, Firebase Realtime Database, Wizards of the Coast's wonderful tabletop RPG - Dungeons & Dragons (5th edition), and a whole lot of love.

Special thanks to [DeepOwl](https://github.com/DeepOwl) and based in part on their [summoning](https://github.com/DeepOwl/summoning) project.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
